This was a group project. Create game of tic-tac-toe through React, using React best practices. First 2 commits are from group work in class. The third commit (see jessigu branch) features some personal edits - refactoring, working towards DRY code, etc. Ideal future edits would include some additional CSS styling, continued refactoring, and simplifying each function's purpose.
